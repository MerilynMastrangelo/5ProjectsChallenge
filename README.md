# 5 Projects in 5 Days
This project created based on YouTube video '5 JavaScript Projects to build' by Andy Sterkowitz. 

He suggested to built these projects until one week. But I decided to challenge myself and I made it in 5 days. One project each day.

I pretend to continue challenge myself to explore the language I'm learning. It was quite easy and do not take me too long. 

I recognise I need improve some code and maybe later add some style.

### Some rules on implementation:

1. Do Not Focus in Styling
2. Do Not Copy Code
3. Continue Passive Learning
4. Aim For 1 week.
